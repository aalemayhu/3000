# 3000

a minimal music player for macOS.

The main feature of the app is that it can play music from a folder and it
treats it as a playlist. **Only MP3 and M4A files are supported**. For the
player to show artwork the metadata has to be set.

Use at your own risk.

## Why not use iTunes?

Whenever I tried using iTunes for this it has always copied over the files.  I
could probably disable this, but wanted to scratch an itch and do some
programming just for fun again.
